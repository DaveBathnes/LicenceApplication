### How could you make the taxi license cost calculator more valuable for customers?

Initially I was surprised at the requirement to write a console application, but can see the value in this as an exercise and enjoyed looking at this. Things I would like to explore if doing more:

1. I would convert the cost calculator to be an online tool. Although I like console applications, the ability to centrally manage software, deploy it using a web browser, construct a modern UI, and use UI packages to provide guidance, navigation, and validation, would be very worthwhile here.

2. Similar to the above, customers also include the public, and an online tool to check eligibility of taxi licenses could be exposed publicly, so they would be able to check their own eligibility and find out costs. This would then free up time for the licensing team. If the licensing team still receive queries from the public they could direct them to the online tool, as well as using the online tool to provide immediate answers.

4. I would then be interested in other features that could be provided in a licence management product. For example, moving from eligibility and cost into being able to submit actual applications, and take these through into completion and delivery of the licence. And storing the data in a database and publishing that data on the website of existing licenses.

5. I have included basic configuration so that the prices, discounts, and messages can be edited. In future these could be managed through a user interface that the licensing team would have access to.

### What is your preferred test framework and why?

Perhaps it is because I 'grew up' with Microsoft technologies (from a coding point of view), but I like the Microsoft Suite of tools for both development and testing. Particularly the Visual Studio IDE, the ability to construct Unit Tests, create Mock Services, and automate tests within the IDE.

I have also previously worked in teams using Visual Studio Team Foundation Server and the suite of collaboration tools that integrate with Source Control, and provide agile project management facilities, build suites, and issue tracking and resolution.

Despite this, more recently I have been working with web technologies and have been using Selenium both for testing and automation, and very much enjoy experiencing a mix of tools rather than simply sticking to one technology stack.

### How would you speed up the process of turning business ideas into features that customers can use?

I believe one key goal is to widen the pool from which business ideas can be submitted. Particularly within IT and Development Teams, a lot of business expertise is held in IT staff heads, through working with many systems. However, it is often left to the business owners and workers to submit ideas, and these can end up being inpractical, impossible, or need technical expertise to be advised upon. 

Similar to the above, engaging a combined forum of business and IT staff would help to create ideas that are well formulated and possible to complete. Having a product owner who is regularly involved in maintenance of the product helps to work on ideas.

It is also perhaps an obvious point, but agile methodologies are specifically designed for this goal. Working on small chunks of work, with regular releases, and regular interaction with business owners, means that features can be prioritised and made available very quickly.

### How would you go about developing a new feature as part of an agile team?

1. The feature should have a clear business value. Normally this stage of agile development would involve communication between the product owner and the development team. The business value should be assessed and then can be prioritised alongside other features.
2. The feature should be described in a single manageable and estimable package. For example, if it would take longer to complete than a single 'sprint' (e.g 2 weeks), it should be split up into smaller features.
3. The feature should then be scheduled into a sprint to be worked on by the development team.
4. I enjoy working in development teams that have good communication and cross-skilling so that anyone could work on any feature. If not experienced in a particular area, people could mentor others in pair programming.
5. I have also enjoyed daily 'stand-up' meetings and believe this is a good way of working on features and allowing time every day for people to raise issues and things they may be struggling with.
6. Assuming no issues, the feature should be unit tested and acceptance tested within the sprint (planned set of work).


### What is the difference between unit and acceptance testing?

Unit testing tests individual units of code. For example, I may have written a function which takes a number and performs a mathematical equation on it to return a certain amount. To unit test that code I could write a number of unit tests which may cover ensuring the right result is returned (without just replicating the original code), and also that the function had proper error handling.

Acceptance testing is at a higher level than individual code functions, and would consist of working with the end users to ensure the software built does what they want it to do (i.e. that they accept it as doing what they expect). It is likely to be more directly evaluated by user requirements. In agile development this could be a feature or user story which should be described with acceptance testing requirements in mind.
